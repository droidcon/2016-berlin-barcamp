#Feedback Session

Most people enjoyed the day, meeting interesting people, learning new topics.

* Sounds at stage 2 wasn't good.
* There could have been more rapid demo sessions, presenters don't like to do the same pitch more than 5 times
* It should have been communicated that the Mobility area was only one day.
* It would have been nice to have more smaller groups.
* Better encouragement, it is easy to come up on stage to present a session idea.
