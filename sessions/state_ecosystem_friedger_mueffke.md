#The state of the Open Android Ecosystem

The majority of the audience was not happy about the current state, shown by choosing a red paper, instead of a green one.

The sessions did not come to any conclusion but several topics where discussed. For some topics facts where missing, hence,
take the statements below with precaution.

* Security: Security updates are not delivered to "out-dated" devices. A big thread is building up!
* Bugs: Fragmentation of Android versions is an issue because compatibility library is buggy, Google should improve QA
* EU commission formal investigations: The commission is investigating and found three issues/objections.
  * Apps Bundling: Google Play Store app can only be installed together with a set of 10(?) other Google apps. The Play Store
  has to be placed on the home screen of the phone.
    * Friedger explained [some issues](http://www.openintents.org/blog/2016/06/02/Google-Open-Android-Ecosystem.html) written down he found.
    * Google says some bundled apps are not very successful, there are successful competitors.
  * Anti-Fragmentation: Device makers must not use uncompatible forks of Android.
    * As developers we want a strong regulation that devices are compatible.
    * A device can be called an Android device if it passes the [Compatibility Test Stuite](https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/). This is open source and can be enhanced/extended.
    * Developers can put pressure on device makers by verifying compatibility by using the [safety net API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html).
  * Revenue Sharing: Device makers can get revenu shares when using Google search as default search engine. Other search engines have less chances to be used.
