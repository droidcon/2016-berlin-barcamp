# MVVM & RxJava - The Perfect Mix

Since the Model-View-Presenter pattern and RxJava have been adopted more and more in the Android community, the Model-View-ViewModel pattern emerged as a natural extension combining the benefits of these two concepts.
Simple code snippets will be used to explain MVVM implementation and testing and showcase the advantages over MVP.
Engineering war stories along with our lessons learned will be shared so you can avoid the mistakes we have made.
I will also give you our answer for: is Rx a remedy for all ills and difficulties in every codebase or can the medicine have unforeseen adverse effects?
