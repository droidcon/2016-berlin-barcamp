# Dependency Injection & Toothpick

During this talk I'll introduce Toothpick, a new dependency injection framework for Java with special focus on Android.
It offers a compromise between complexity and performance, being as simple as Roboguice and almost as fast as Dagger!
By the way, the testing integration is simply awesome!
You will see that a toothpick is sharper than a dagger!

# Q&A

* Toothpick will remain under the Apache 2 license
* Library encourages application or activity instead of contex injection
* Footprint on the app is not clear yet, as it has only been released two weeks ago
* It is possible to annotate all kinds of providers, even in a lazy way
